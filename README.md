# 🔆 Solar Powered RO Water Purification System

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a **solar-powered reverse osmosis (RO) water purification system**
designed for rural areas with unreliable electricity supply.  
The system integrates **renewable energy**, **embedded control**, and **real-time sensing**
to ensure safe drinking water.
